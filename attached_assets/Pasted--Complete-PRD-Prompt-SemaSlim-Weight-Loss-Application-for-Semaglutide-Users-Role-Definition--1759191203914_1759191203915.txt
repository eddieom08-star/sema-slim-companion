## Development Instructions

Create a production-ready application following this complete specification. The application should be built using modern React/TypeScript with a focus on user experience, data security, and scalability. Implement the core features first (weight tracking, medication logging, basic food scanning) before adding advanced gamification and analytics features.

Ensure all healthcare data handling follows HIPAA compliance guidelines and implement proper security measures from the beginning. The application should feel like a premium health app while being specifically tailored to the unique needs of semaglutide users.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
